# Nginx reverse proxy server

Implemented an nginx reverse proxy server to serve static content hosted on vm's running docker containers. The project is built using a jenkins pipeline which takes the nginx configuration file and deploys it to the proxy server.




## Usage

This repo holds the nginx.conf files that are being pulled by the jenkins pipeline to update our proxy server hosted on an azure vm.
